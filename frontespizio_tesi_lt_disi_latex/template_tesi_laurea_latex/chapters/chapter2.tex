\chapter{Data collection}
\label{cha:data}
The dataset used for the project is the echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs GitHub repository~\cite{chen2020tracking}. The repository contains an ongoing collection of tweet IDs starting on the 28th of January 2020.

The IDs in the dataset are either tweets
\begin{itemize}
	\item from one of the following accounts
	\begin{itemize}
		\item PneumoniaWuhan
		\item CoronaVirusInfo
		\item V2019N
		\item CDCemergency
		\item CDCgov
		\item WHO
		\item HHSGov
		\item NIAIDNews
		\item drtedros
	\end{itemize}
	\item sampled real-time, because they mention specific keywords, such as
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Coronavirus
		\item Epidemic
		\item covid-19
		\item Social Distancing
		\item panic buy
		\item lockdown
		\item \ldots
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset structure}
\label{sec:dataset-struct}

Tweet-IDs are organized in the following way inside of the dataset:

\begin{itemize}
	\item at the top layer, the IDs are sorted into YEAR-MONTH folders
	\item then, in each folder, tweet-IDs are grouped into files with a prefix “coronavirus-tweet-id-” followed by YEAR-MONTH-DATE-HOUR
\end{itemize}


\section{Analyzed period}
\label{sec:period}
COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. However, depending on the considered country, restrictive measures were applied on different dates and for different periods of time. 

For this reason, we decided to analyze tweets from January 2020 to March 2021. In this way, we were able to

\begin{itemize}
	\item consider more countries
	\item better understand when people expressed more negative (or positive) emotions w.r.t the whole period
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dataset statistics for the analyzed period}
\label{subsec:dataset-stats}

The following statistics were obtained considering the dataset structure expressed in \cref{sec:dataset-struct} and the period discussed in \cref{sec:period}

\section{Terms of service}
\label{sec:tos}

To comply with Twitter's Term of Service,\footnote{\url{https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy}} tweets cannot be released publicly: the repository is in fact a collection of Tweet-IDs. Moreover, data is released for non-commercial research use.

\subsection{How to retrieve the data}
\label{subsec:retrieve-data}

The original tweets can be retrieved, or hydrated, using the Python library Twarc with a Twitter developer account. In fact, to be able to use the Twitter API, it is mandatory to apply to Twitter Developer\footnote{\url{https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access}}. When the application has been accepted, the developer will be entitled to access the API using tokens. 

Given the id of a tweet, Twarc uses the tokens of the associated developer account to contact the API, and returns the corresponding information as a json object. However, Twarc also tries to maximize the number of possible IDs per request and, at the same time, makes sure to be compliant with the API usage limits.

\section{Tweets}
\label{sec:tweets}
The structure of the json object for the associated tweet depends on the version of the API used: for this project, we have used Standard v1.1 to hydrate the tweet. \footnote{\url{https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet}}

In general, a tweet is described by the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{id}, the integer representation of the unique identifier for this Tweet
	\item \texttt{created\_at}, UTC time when this Tweet was created
	\item \texttt{full\_text}, the actual UTF-8 text of the status update (not truncated)
	\item \texttt{user}, the user who posted this Tweet
	\item \texttt{retweeted\_status}, the presence of this attribute distinguishes Retweets from typical Tweets
	\item \texttt{lang}, indicates a BCP 47 language identifier corresponding to the machine-detected language of the Tweet text, or und if no language could be detected
\end{itemize}

Further information about the user that posted the tweet are available in the \texttt{user} field, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{id}, the integer representation of the unique identifier for this User
	\item \texttt{name}, the name of the user, as they have defined it
	\item \texttt{screen\_name}, the screen name, handle, or alias that this user identifies themselves with
	\item \texttt{location}, the user-defined location for this account's profile. Not necessarily a location, nor machine-parseable
	\item \texttt{description}, the user-defined UTF-8 string describing their account
	\item \texttt{profile\_image\_url\_https}, a HTTPS-based URL pointing to the user's profile image
\end{itemize}

For the scope of the project, we decided to keep a simpler representation of the original json object, with only the most relevant fields:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={Final json object for a Tweet}, captionpos=b, label={lst:tweet_json}]
