\chapter{Results and discussion}
\label{cha:results}

This chapter is meant to show and discuss the results obtained from the application of the methods introduced in \Cref{cha:methods}.

\section{LIWC and EmoLex comparison}
\label{sec:comparison}

Before going into the details, it is worth showing the comparison between the results obtained using Emolex and the ones with LIWC. In particular, we decided to use the z-score of the data obtained from the analysis of both of them.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_emotions_and_liwc_categories_comparison.svg}
    	\caption{Comparison between the z-score of the emotions and the z-score of the LIWC categories in the English tweets}
    	\label{fig:en-emotions-liwc-comparison}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{it_emotions_and_liwc_categories_comparison.svg}
    	\caption{Comparison between the z-score of the emotions and the z-score of the LIWC categories in the Italian tweets}
    	\label{fig:it-emotions-liwc-comparison}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{es_emotions_and_liwc_categories_comparison.svg}
    	\caption{Comparison between the z-score of the emotions and the z-score of the LIWC categories in the Spanish tweets}
    	\label{fig:es-emotions-liwc-comparison}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:en-emotions-liwc-comparison}, \Cref{fig:it-emotions-liwc-comparison}, and \Cref{fig:es-emotions-liwc-comparison} show how the course of the emotion/category pairs looks similar. Moreover, on several occasions the two lines overlap and, even if there is a gap, they generally tend to increase or decrease simultaneously. Instead, the differences are probably related to a different word/emotion (or word/category) association in the two dictionaries. Furthermore, they use a different set of words: for example, “pandemic”, “virus”, and “vaccine” are not present in LIWC, making it more general than EmoLex.

In any case, the results obtained from the comparison are particularly good for those languages, such as Catalan, where it is not possible to use LIWC due to the lack of appropriate dictionaries.

\section{Emotion detection over time - by language}
\label{sec:emotion-by-language-results}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_5_liwc_categories_abs.svg}
    	\caption{Number of weekly users per emotion in the English tweets}
    	\label{fig:en-5-liwc-categories-abs}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:en-5-liwc-categories-abs} displays the number of users that expressed a particular emotion in a given week, considering the English tweets. Instead, the gray dashed line indicates the number of users that posted at least one tweet during a week. The fact that the data collection migrated to AWS around June 2020, explains why the number of tweets almost doubled from 2020/06/01 to 2020/06/08.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_5_liwc_categories.svg}
    	\caption{Proportion of weekly users per emotion in the English tweets}
    	\label{fig:en-5-liwc-categories}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:en-5-liwc-categories} instead shows the proportion of users that expressed a particular emotion in a given week, considering the English tweets. Here we can notice some interesting results: first of all, we can see how the Negemo course seems to be similar to the  Anger one: especially if we consider the peaks. However, this is not always the case: in fact, further analysis proved that Negemo can be seen as the combination of Anger, Sad, and Anx. Given its redundancy, we removed Negemo from the other graphics to achieve even better data visualization.

Secondly, there are some cases where all the emotions seem to have the same course. For the most, we can notice how, when negative emotions increase, positive emotions decrease (and vice versa). However, during the week starting on 2020/02/24, the proportion of users that expressed Anger, Sad, Anx, Posemo, and Negemo raised. This probably happened because users during that time were particularly emotional and used several more words within a tweet.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_4_liwc_categories_subplots.svg}
    	\caption{Proportion of weekly users expressing a particular emotion in the English tweets}
    	\label{fig:en-4-liwc-categories-subplots}
\end{figure}

Before approaching the data normalization, we have also tried to divide the different emotions courses into subplots. If we take a look at \Cref{fig:en-4-liwc-categories-subplots}, both global (and local) maxima and minima are visible to the naked eye. However, the comparison between different emotions becomes really difficult.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_4_liwc_categories_standardized.svg}
    	\caption{Z-score of weekly users per emotion in the English tweets}
    	\label{fig:en-4-liwc-categories-std}
\end{figure}

The z-score instead proved to be a very useful data normalization. As we can see from \Cref{fig:en-4-liwc-categories-std}, not only peaks are noticeable even if we are considering the emotions altogether, but we can also understand which time frames are characterized by a greater (or lower) emotion value w.r.t. the mean value of that particular emotion. For example, it is possible to see that, starting on 2020/03/16, the proportion of users that expressed a positive emotion w.r.t. the mean value of positive emotion over the whole period, surpassed all the other emotions w.r.t. their mean value over the whole period. For the same reason, we can see that the week starting on 2020/02/24 was characterized by a greater value of Anx, even if in \Cref{fig:en-5-liwc-categories} the proportion of users that expressed a positive emotion is always higher.

From the comparison of the course of the emotions, we have manually selected some peaks (i.e. week) to understand which words were used the most. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_most_used_liwc_words_2020_02_24.svg}
    	\caption{Proportion of most used words on 2020/02/24 that express an emotion in the English tweets}
    	\label{fig:en-most-used-liwc-words-2020-02-24}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:en-most-used-liwc-words-2020-02-24} shows which are the 50 most used words in the English tweets during the week starting on 2020/02/24.

From the graphic we can that the majority of the words expressing a negative emotion are also associated with Anger, Sad, or Anx. This explains the choice to remove Negemo from the other figures.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_most_used_words_2020_02_24.svg}
    	\caption{Proportion of most used words on 2020/02/24 that express emotion/sentiment in the English tweets}
    	\label{fig:en-most-used-words-2020-02-24}
\end{figure}

Instead, \Cref{fig:en-most-used-words-2020-02-24} shows the results obtained from EmoLex for the same week.

Here, we can see that some words, such as “virus”, are only related to a sentiment and not to any other emotion. On the other hand, “epidemic” is associated with almost the totality of the emotions. This is particularly problematic, because the course of the emotions tends to be all the same.

\section{Emotion detection over time - by gender}
\label{sec:emotion-by-gender-results}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_4_emotions_per_category_with_course_subplot_1.svg}
    	\caption{Proportion of weekly men/women expressing a particular emotion in the English tweets}
    	\label{fig:en-4-emotions-per-category-course-subplot-1}
\end{figure}


\Cref{fig:en-4-emotions-per-category-course-subplot-1} introduces the results of the analysis of the emotions expressed by females and males in the English tweets during the whole period. In this case, the dotted gray line represents the proportion of users that, independently from the category they belong to, expressed a certain emotion on a given week. However, this line differs from the results obtained in \Cref{fig:en-4-emotions-subplot-1}, because we are now considering only the users with a certain number of tweets (see \Cref{subsec:m3inference} for further details).

We can also see that women tend to write a lot more tweets that convey joy in most cases. This seems to be also the case for sadness and fear. However, if we consider for example the fear, the gap is very small. Instead, men seem to express slightly more anger over the considered period, but the two lines mostly overlap.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_4_emotions_per_category_over_mean_subplot_1.svg}
    	\caption{Men/Women expressing the weekly proportion of a particular emotion w.r.t. the average value among all users}
    	\label{fig:en-4-emotions-per-category-course-mean-1}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:en-4-emotions-per-category-course-mean-1} is a variation of \Cref{fig:en-4-emotions-per-category-course-subplot-1}, where the gray dotted line indicates the average value of a particular emotion expressed by all the users (i.e. independently from the category) over the whole period. Instead, the proportion reported by the other lines represents how much a certain gender expressed a particular emotion in a given week w.r.t. the mean value among the users. For example, both males and females expressed 10\% more anger during the week starting on 2020/02/24.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_4_emotions_per_age_subplot_1.svg}
    	\caption{Proportion of weekly users per age expressing a particular emotion in the English tweets}
    	\label{fig:en-4-emotions-per-age-subplot-1}
\end{figure}

From the inference process, we also got information about age brackets. \Cref{fig:en-4-emotions-per-age-subplot-1} shows the course of the emotions per age for the considered period. The results obtained are very intriguing because there is always a noticeable gap between users with less than forty years and those with at least forty years. In particular, it seems that the ones belonging to the second age bracket are more inclined to convey their feelings.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{en_number_of_emotions_per_age.svg}
    	\caption{Proportion of users per age expressing zero or more emotions/sentiments}
    	\label{fig:en-4-emotions-per-age-per-number}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:en-4-emotions-per-age-per-number} shows the proportion of users that, in a given week, expressed a certain number of emotions/sentiments. As we can see, \(14 \%\) of the users with less than forty years did not express any emotion. This result is very interesting and could be caused by different reasons. For example, it may be possible that younger users like to write shorter tweets. In fact, with a very restricted set of words, it is likely to not express feelings at all. Besides, they could use different methods to convey their emotions, such through emoticons or slang: neither of them are in fact recognized by EmoLex. Finally, it could also be the case that they are apathetic. In any case, the fact that a great number of users with less than forty years did not express any emotion explains why there is such a large gap between the course of the emotions in \Cref{fig:en-4-emotions-per-age-subplot-1}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{it_users_per_state.svg}
    	\caption{Proportion of users per state in Italy}
    	\label{fig:it-users-state}
\end{figure}

Finally, we can now move to the analysis of the users' emotions from a specific location. \Cref{fig:it-users-state} shows the proportion of users per state in Italy. From the results that we have obtained, we decided to consider only Lombardia, Lazio, Emilia Romagna, and Campania for further studies. In this way, we are able to better visualize the data and we have more possibilities to get stabler results. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{it_anger_4_states.svg}
    	\caption{Proportion of weekly users that expressed anger in Lombardia, Lazio, Emilia Romagna and Campania}
    	\label{fig:it-anger-4-states}
\end{figure}

From \Cref{fig:it-anger-4-states} we can actually understand which events had an impact on every state. For example, it is possible to notice a peak of anger on the week starting on the 2020/10/19. Here it is a bit more difficult to understand what actually happened without more complex techniques. However, from the analysis of the news, it is possible to link that particular time frame with the first of a series of different decrees, issued to stop the spreading of the disease once more after the first lockdown. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    	\includegraphics[scale=.35]{it_2_emotions_Campania.svg}
    	\caption{Proportion of weekly users that expressed anger and joy in Campania}
    	\label{fig:it-2-emotions-campania}
\end{figure}

Of course, it is also possible to consider a single state, for example Campania, as showed in \Cref{fig:it-2-emotions-campania}. Here we can notice even more how, by looking at the week starting on 2020/02/17, the news of the first coronavirus case in Codogno, had an impact that people's emotions. Unfortunately, given that these results were obtained with a lexicon that has not been originally designed for the Italian language, they must be taken with extreme care. Moreover, trying to manually associate events cannot really be considered a best practice to end up with valid and reliable results.
