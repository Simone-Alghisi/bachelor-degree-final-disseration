\emph{
  I would like to thank first of all Prof. Montresor, who gave me the possibility to carry out my traineeship with Eurecat - Centro Tecnol√≥gico de Catalunya.\\
  Secondly, both Cristian Consonni and David Laniado, who supervised my work at the Big Data \& Data Science Department, and always helped me during my traineeship to get the best possible experience.\\
  Finally, my family, who always supported me during these years in every way possible, and my friends, both in the university and in my hometown: even though I am aware that I complain a lot, you have really made these three years more enjoyable.\\
  Once again, thanks for believing in me.
